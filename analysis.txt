reverse(): To reverse the order of elements in the list, the function needs to go through each element of the list and rearrange the pointers to reverse the order.
This requires traversing the entire list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

remove_if(): The remove_if() function deletes nodes from the list based on condition.
In the worst case, the function may need to look at each element of the list to determine whether it should be remove. This results in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
